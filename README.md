# Pollution-Monitoring-System
The air pollution is becoming a critical condition in urban areas. The number of
Carbon particles are increasing day by day to a modern lifestyle. It is advised to
use an IoT enabled solution to monitor the volume of carbon particles in the air.

### Scope:
● Detects, Measures the level of emitted Carbon gas and Smoke.
● Gas Sensor MQ2 to detect CO and Smoke.


### Objectives:

● To monitor the level of carbon gas emission into the air.
● To give continuous notification about the volume of carbon gas.


### Tools & Technology:

* Programming language: ​ ​ Arduino
* Operating system (Development): ​ ​ Linux Ubuntu
* IDE: ​ Arduino IDE
* Device:
  NodeMCU(Part no- ESP8266MOD)
* Sensor:
Gas Sensor(Part no- MQ2)
* Library: ​ ​ ESP8266WiFi, MQ2, Wi-Fi
* Other tools:
